# What I think is wrong and what would I do to fix it (roughly)
- Whole codebase is contained inside one project - no separation of concerns, tight coupling, no abstractions, just direct implementations
    - Would separate into Domain, Application and Infrastructure
- Would introduce DI
- Company model is not very nice
    - Contains mock values, which should be declared in Mock implementation of Company repo
    - Type is just a string
- Entire company service BL just in one method (should be separated)
    - Validation (would implement as separate builder-style validator for customer)
    - Repository instantiated inside method
    - Would separate company type handling into separate factory returning different handlers according to type
